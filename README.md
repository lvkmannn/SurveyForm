# Survey Form Project
This is a simple survey form built using HTML and CSS, designed as a personal project to collect user input. The form includes fields for name, email, age, role selection, account type, preferred programming languages, and additional comments. It features a visually appealing design with a background image and gradient overlay, responsive layout, and user-friendly form elements. The project showcases fundamental web development skills and serves as a practice for creating and styling forms.

Feel free to explore and modify the code to suit your own projects or learning purposes.
